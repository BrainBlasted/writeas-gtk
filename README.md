# Write.as GTK App
A Write.as desktop app that targets all freedesktop.org compliant desktops, e.g. 
GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, etc; basically everything except Windows, Mac, iOS, and 
Android. It allows you to compose and publish posts to https://write.as/.

For a UI toolkit it uses GTK (where some systems may slightly prefer, say, Qt), 
but do to the simplicity of the app this shouldn't be much of a problem to anyone.
